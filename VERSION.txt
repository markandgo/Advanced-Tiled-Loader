0.10.2 (04/26/12)

- AdvTiledLoader can now be correctly required from any subfolder

	were different

0.10.0 (04/11/12)

	objects, polyline objects, tilemap offset, and tilemap propterties.

- Advanced Tile Loader now has a wiki page and a github repository!
- Cleaned up the code quite a bit.
- Classes are now broken up into individual files rather than grouping similar

	camelCase is used to separate words instead of underscores. Internal 
	functions and data are now prefixed with an underscore.
- Sprite batch mode can now be set through the map or through individual tile 
	layers. Tile layer settings take precedence.
- A bug with layer transparency has been fixed.
- Tile:draw() now accepts parameters for scaling, rotation, and offset.
- TileLayer:drawAfterTile() now works with multiple functions
- Forcing a redraw is now automatic when you switch sprite batch modes.
- Added support for flipped tiles that were introduced in Tiled version 0.7.1
