Advanced Tiled Loader
========

Advanced Tiled Loader (ATL) loads and renders [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) maps inside of the [LÃ¶ve2D](http://love2d.org) game framework.

This was a fork of Kadoba's Advanced Tiled Loader.

Latest update is found on the master branch.

Supports every known feature except for the following:
* Object rotation
* Specifying draw order
* Tile animation

Stable release:

Example: 

````lua
atl = require 'src'
map = atl.load('map.tmx')

function love.draw()
	map:draw(x,y)
end
````
